If omitted, and the targetPort is specified as part of the service's port specification, traffic to the service port will be forwarded to one of the endpoints on the specified `targetPort`.

When endpoints in different networks cannot reach each other directly, an Istio Gateway can be used to establish connectivity (usually using the `AUTO_PASSTHROUGH` mode in a Gateway Server). This is an advanced configuration used typically for spanning an Istio mesh over multiple clusters.

    /// The locality associated with the endpoint. A locality corresponds to a failure domain (e.g., country/region/zone). Arbitrary failure domain hierarchies can be represented by separating each encapsulating failure domain by /. For example, the locality of an an endpoint in US, in US-East-1 region, within availability zone az-1, in data center rack r11 can be represented as us/us-east-1/az-1/r11. Istio will configure the sidecar to route to endpoints within the same locality as the sidecar. If none of the endpoints in the locality are available, endpoints parent locality (but within the same network ID) will be chosen. For example, if there are two endpoints in same network (networkID \"n1\"), say e1 with locality us/us-east-1/az-1/r11 and e2 with locality us/us-east-1/az-2/r12, a sidecar from us/us-east-1/az-1/r11 locality will prefer e1 from the same locality over e2 from a different locality. Endpoint e2 could be the IP associated with a gateway (that bridges networks n1 and n2), or the IP associated with a standard service endpoint.
