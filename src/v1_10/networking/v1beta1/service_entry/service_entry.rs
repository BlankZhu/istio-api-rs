For HTTP traffic, generated route configurations will include http route domains for both the `addresses` and `hosts` field values and the destination will be identified based on the HTTP Host/Authority header. If one or more IP addresses are specified, the incoming traffic will be identified as belonging to this service if the destination IP matches the IP/CIDRs specified in the addresses field. If the Addresses field is empty, traffic will be identified solely based on the destination port. In such scenarios, the port on which the service is being accessed must not be shared by any other service in the mesh. In other words, the sidecar will behave as a simple TCP proxy, forwarding incoming traffic on a specified port to the specified destination endpoint IP/host.
